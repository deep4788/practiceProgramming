Logging Framework
=================

A simple logging framework.

Description
-----------

By default the log file is written in the lib directory. I wrote this library pretty fast, so I am sure there are a lot of improvements that can be made.

How to Build
------------
```sh
$ mkdir build bin lib
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Usage
-----
```sh
$ cd bin
$ ./logging
```
